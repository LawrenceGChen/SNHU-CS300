# SNHU-CS300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course, I implemented a variety of data structures to sort and print out course codes and titles, along with their prerequisites. The problem was determining which of the data structures was most efficient for both space and time for sorting operations.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by implementing each data structure one at a time, ensuring that I understood each data structure's functionality, advantages, and disadvantages throughout the process. Data structures are important to understand because they are what is handling the data when developing an application. Any microscopic inefficiencies due to the wrong data structure being utilized can result in colossal performance degradation when the application is being used at scale.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

The main thing I did to overcome the roadblocks I encountered while going through this project was to go back over the reading material, as well as consulting other materials regarding the data structures that I was implementing. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

It has made me more thoughtful with regards to the data structures that are correct for the code that I am working on. Each data structure has its advantages and disadvantages, and different data structures are ideal for different use cases.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project helped me to ensure that I am commenting as I implement code, ensuring the code is clearly implemented and explained for anyone who may review it. I also made sure to avoid having massive functions, instead opting for modular code to maximize readability.
